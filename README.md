# RBD GWAS analysis

This repository contains scripts used to perform a colocalisation analysis using the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) GWAS and two eQTL datasets:

- [eQTLGen](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/447367v1.full)
- [PsychENCODE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545857)

Scripts and results of analyses have been described in the following workflows:

1. [RBD_coloc.Rmd](./workflows/RBD_coloc.Rmd): `Rmd` detailing coloc set up and analysis of results. 
2. [RBD_coloc_tissue_cell_specificity.Rmd](./workflows/RBD_coloc_tissue_cell_specificity.Rmd): `Rmd` detailing tissue- and cell-type-specificity of genes identified by coloc.
3. [RBD_manuscript_figures](./workflows/RBD_manuscript_figures.Rmd): `Rmd` detailing code used to produce manuscript figures pertaining to coloc analyses.
